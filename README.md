# apod-collector
APOD Collector is a Python script that downloads and archives images from NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) using the official NASA API.  It allows you to fetch all APOD images over a configurable date range (e.g. the last 5 years) and save them locally in an organized way.
